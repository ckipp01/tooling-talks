  Scalameta. Olaf's fingerprints are all over the standard Scala toolchain.

  notes = """Welcome back to another episode of Tooling Talks! I'm your host
  Chris and I have an episode for you today that I've wanted to do for quite
  some time. Early on when I was first getting started with open Source
  Gabriele was one of the first people I interacted with. He's got a ton of
  experience with the Scalameta toolchain, and is one of the "founding fathers"
  of Metals. Furthermore, he's also part of the SIP (Scala Improvement Process)
  committee for Scala 3. In this talk we'll dive into the SIP process, talk
  about what it is, how tooling relates to it, and a bit about some of the
  current proposals. So without further ado, let's dive in, and thanks for
  joining."""
