# The process

Once contacted, if the interviewee agrees, the following steps will be taken:

1. Over the next couple weeks after agreeing to the talk, a series of questions
   will be prepared and shown to the interviewee. This won't be a strict
   guideline to the exact questions to be asked, but will serve to give the
   interviewee a general sense of what types of questions will be asked. Most of
   the time follow-ups and related questions to what are listed are free-game.
   Also there may be questions from the audience that we can take if they are
   relevant to the topic at hand. This is also a great time of the interviewee
   to mention anything they may not want to speak about.

2. Leading up to the talk an avatar will be created of the interview similar to
   that of the one I use for
   [myself](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13974112?v=4). This is
   mainly so that a nice unified look can be applied for everything.

3. The interview itself will be conducted via
   [squadcast](https://squadcast.fm/), which is (browser based) tool that ensure
   your audio is first recorded locally and then stored rather than streamed to
   a tool like Zoom and then captured.

4. After the stream the recordings will be edited and put up to be distributed
   to all your favorite podcast platforms!
