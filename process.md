# The process

Once contacted, if the interviewee agrees, the following steps will be taken:

1. We'll get a date scheduled that will work for both of us.
2. Over the next couple weeks after agreeing to the talk, a series of questions
   will be prepared and shown to the interviewee. This won't be a strict
   guideline or the exact questions to be asked, but will serve as a way to give
   the interviewee a general sense of what types of questions will be asked.
   Most of the time follow-ups and related questions to what are listed are
   free-game. Also there may be questions that someone on GitHub asked that we
   can tackle if they are relevant. (Before each episode I post about them
   [here](https://github.com/ckipp01/tooling-talks/discussions).) This is also a
   great time of the interviewee to mention anything they may not want to speak
   about.

2. Leading up to the talk an avatar will be created of the interview similar to
   the ones used for [everyone on the site](https://www.tooling-talks.com/) to
   ensure everything looks good together.

3. The interview itself will be conducted via
   [squadcast](https://squadcast.fm/), which is (browser based) tool that
   ensures your audio is first recorded locally and then stored rather than
   streamed to a tool like Zoom and then captured. This gives me two separate
   audio tracks which is much easier to edit.

4. After the stream the recordings will be edited and put up to be distributed
   to all your favorite podcast platforms!
