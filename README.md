# Tooling talks

Tooling talks is monthly series of talks about tooling.

## Impetus

The idea for this series is came out of a combination of things:

1. I enjoy talking about tooling. I especially enjoy talking about tooling with
   others that work in tooling, enjoy tooling, and are willing to talk with me
   about tooling.
2. Covid times have been difficult with less opportunity to get together during
   conferences, meetups, and other places that you often see others with
   like-minded interests. To put it simply, I miss talking to others about
   tooling.
3. Even during a lot of online conferences there isn't a large focus on tooling.
   So we'll overcompensate here, and we'll focus on it 100% of the time.

## Schedule

*TBD* The schedule for this is currently being worked on. When the first talk is
announced, you'll find it listed here with a link to where it will be streamed.

## The format of the talk

The format will be that of one similar to a podcast. The conversation will be
quite informal, and also allow for some questions from those that are
watching if they fit into the context of what is being spoken about. The
questions won't be that surprising as they'll be mostly prepared ahead of time
and approved by the individual being interviewed. A length to shoot for
will be around the one hour mark however this may vary slightly depending on how
the interview is going.

## The process

Once contacted, if the interviewee agrees, the following steps will be taken:

1. Over the next couple weeks after agreeing to the talk, a series of questions
   will be prepared and shown to the interviewee. This won't be a strict
   guideline to the exact questions to be asked, but will serve to give the
   interviewee a general sense of what types of questions will be asked. Most of
   the time follow-ups and related questions to what are listed are free-game.
   Also there may be questions from the audience that we can take if they are
   relevant to the topic at hand. This is also a great time of the interviewee
   to mention anything they may not want to speak about.

2. Leading up to the talk an avatar will be created of the interview similar to
   that of the one I use for
   [myself](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/13974112?v=4). This is
   mainly so that a nice unified OBS screen can be created and for content
   leading up to the talk.

3. The interview itself will be streamed [here on
   Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ckipp) which will easily allow for anyone to
   easily watch and comment. There will be moderators to ensure there is no
   harassment or anything of that nature during the interview. The way this will
   work is that we'll do a call together, and then I will stream both of us
   embedded in an OBS scene. If need be we can practice this ahead of time if
   there is any uncertainty.

4. After the stream the full video will then be uploaded to YouTube for those
   that may have missed the actual stream.
