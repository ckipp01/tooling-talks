## Schedule

All talks will be streamed live at [twitch.tv/ckipp](https://www.twitch.tv/ckipp).

- A talk with Ólafur Páll Geirsson - Sunday, May 30th - 7PM CEST / 10AM PDT

## Impetus

The idea for this series came out of a combination of things:

1. I enjoy talking about tooling. I especially enjoy talking about tooling with
   others that work in tooling, enjoy tooling, and are willing to talk with me
   about tooling.
2. Covid times have been difficult with less opportunity to get together during
   conferences, meetups, and other places that you often see others with
   like-minded interests. To put it simply, I miss talking to others about
   tooling.
3. Even during a lot of online conferences there isn't a large focus on tooling.
   So we'll overcompensate here, and we'll focus on it 100% of the time.
4. Getting into tooling is hard, but I don't think it needs to be. Part of this
   is a lack of content or an assumption that it's too difficult. Let's combat
   this.

## The format of the talk

The format will be that of one similar to a podcast. The conversation will be
quite informal, and also allow for some questions from those that are
watching if they fit into the context of what is being spoken about. The
questions won't be that surprising as they'll be mostly prepared ahead of time
and approved by the individual being interviewed. A length to shoot for
will be around the one hour mark however this may vary slightly depending on how
the interview is going.

## Code of Conduct

These talks will follow the [Scala Code of Conduct](https://www.scala-lang.org/conduct/).
