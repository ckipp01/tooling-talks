## Impetus

The idea for this series came out of a combination of things:

1. I enjoy talking about tooling. I especially enjoy talking about tooling with
   others that work in tooling, enjoy tooling, and are willing to talk with me
   about tooling.
2. Covid times have been difficult with less opportunity to get together during
   conferences, meetups, and other places that you often see others with
   like-minded interests. To put it simply, I miss talking to others about
   tooling.
3. Even during a lot of online conferences there isn't a large focus on tooling.
   So we'll overcompensate here, and we'll focus on it 100% of the time.
4. Getting into tooling is hard, but I don't think it needs to be. Part of this
   is a lack of content or an assumption that it's too difficult. Let's combat
   this.
