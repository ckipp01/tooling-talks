# Recording Tips

Below are some tips to help ensure everything sounds as clear as possible. The
better you can sound locally, the less editing I'll need to do, and the better
the end result will sound. Every little bit helps!

NOTE: I use [SquadCast](https://squadcast.fm/) to record the episodes. It's a
browser-based software so no need to download anything. The main reason I use
this is to get two separate audio tracks. Plus, they buffer locally before
uploading so even if the sounds seems to get wonky due to a bad connection, it
won't impact the end recording. It's a great product.

So, here are some tips.

  - Wear headphones. This is one of the most important ones. This will keep
      sounds from echoing and your microphone actually picking up the other
      person talking.
  - An external mic is almost _always_ better than just using your built in mic.
      If not, if you have mic on your headset, those typically work as well. Use
      the mic on your computer if you have nothing else.
  - Being in a quiet room is important. Especially if you don't have an external
      mic, you'll pick up a lot background noise. Making sure you're in a quiet
      place will help with this. Also, being in a room with other things around
      will actual dampen background noise. Being in a big empty room even if it's
      quiet will make you sound like you're in a big empty echoey room.
  - Be mindful of things on your desk or around that might make quite a bit of
      noise that you may not notice. For example metal water bottles that you
      unscrew or screw on, something that bangs against your desk, or even a
      squeaky chair! These things can all be picked up by your mic (especially
      if you're just using your computer mic), so best to reduce them if
      possible.

All the above are just tips, so don't stress out about them! Either way, we'll
have a great convo, we'll get the podcast recorded, and people will enjoy it!
