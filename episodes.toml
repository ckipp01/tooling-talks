  Olaf. Just about two year ago I sent an email to Olaf, introduced myself,
  told him I loved Metals and that I wanted to help. This ultimately lead to my
  affinity with Developer tooling and also my entryway into that world. You may
  know Olaf from the impressive amount of tools that's he's either authored or
  worked on. I'm sure you probably use some of them. Metals, the Scala Language
  server, Scalafmt, the defacto formatter for Scala, Scalafix, mdoc, munit, and
  Scalameta. Olaf's fingerprints are all over the standard Scala toolchain.
  Apart the incredible amount of work in open source he's done over the years
  at the Scala Center, Twitter, and now Sourcegraph, he's also a kind and
  helpful individual that's full of insight. It's an absolute pleasure for me
  to have him as my first guest."""

  fantastic tool to help with this is Scala3-migrate, which will help with
  migrating your scalacOptions, ensuring your dependencies are published for
  Scala 3, and even helping to automatically re-write parts of your code. In
  this interview I chat with Meriam and her work on Scala3-migrate, the
  challenges you might encounter as you're migrating your code, and about some
  of the things developers may not think about as they set out to update to
  Scala 3. We'll also dive into her work on Scalafix which unlocked the first
  Scalafix integration in Metals, the Scala Language Sever, as well as helped
  with rewrites for Scala3. We had a great conversation, and super thankful she
  took the time to chat about the works she's been doing, getting into tooling,
  and other untapped areas in the ecosystem."""

  fascinated with this topic lately and looking at the current limitations we
  have in the Scala tooling ecosystem, and thinking about how they could be

  new experience. Everything from tracking changes in your code, how your code
  is stored, and how you write your code is new. She has some great insight
